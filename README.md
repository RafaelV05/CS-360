Event Tracker App Reflection

The Event Tracker app was made to help people quickly add, edit, and check their events in one simple place. It’s meant for users who just want a fast, easy way to keep track of their plans without extra clutter.

The app has a main event list, an add/edit screen, and a small settings screen. I kept the design clean and simple so it’s easy to use and read.

When coding, I used a modular setup with classes for events, data access, and the main activity. I stored everything in SQLite so events stay saved. I tested it in the Android emulator to make sure adding, updating, and deleting all worked right.

The hardest part was getting the database and UI to sync smoothly, but once that clicked it felt great. I’m most proud of how the event list came out — clean, smooth, and easy to use.
